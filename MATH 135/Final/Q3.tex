\textbf{Q03a} We know that $f'(x)$ is defined for all $x \in \mathbb{R}$, and we also know that differentiability applies continuity for $f(x)$. This means that f(x) is both continuous and differentiable for all $x \in \mathbb{R}$.\\
Therefore we can use the bounded derivative theorem (BDT) to find the smallest interval of f(6), and since we know that:
\[ 1 \leq f'(x) \leq 5 \text{ for every } x \in (3,6) \]
Therefore by BDT this implies:
\begin{align*}
f(3) + 1(x-3)  & \leq f(x) \leq f(3) + 5(x-3) \\
1 + 1(x-3)  & \leq f(x) \leq 1+ 5(x-3) \\
1 + x-3  & \leq f(x) \leq 1+ 5x-15 \\
x - 2  & \leq f(x) \leq 5x-14 \\
\end{align*}
Therefore if we let x = 6, we find that:
\begin{align*}
6 - 2  & \leq f(6) \leq 30-14 \\
4  & \leq f(6) \leq 16 
\end{align*}
We can thus say that the smallest interval that $f(6)$ is bounded by is [4,16]\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\


\textbf{Q03b} The textbook defines the second order Taylor Polynomial as (for some real x = a):
\[ T_{2,a}= \sum_{k=0}^{2}\frac{f^{(k)}(a)}{k!}(x-a)^k \]
If we expand this out we get that:
\[ T_{2,a}= \frac{f(a)}{0!}(x-a)^0 + \frac{f'(a)}{1!}(x-a)^1 + \frac{f''(a)}{2!}(x-a)^2  \]
Since we are finding this polynomial centered at x = 3, the polynomial becomes:
\[ T_{2,3}= \frac{f(3)}{0!}(x-3)^0 + \frac{f'(3)}{1!}(x-3)^1 + \frac{f''(3)}{2!}(x-3)^2  \]
From definition we know that $f(3) = 1$, $f'(3) = 5$ and $f''(3) = 7$, so we can simplify:
\begin{align*}
T_{2,3}& = \frac{1}{0!} + \frac{5}{1!}(x-3)^1 + \frac{7}{2!}(x-3)^2 \\
T_{2,3}& = 1 + 5(x-3) + \frac{7}{2}(x^2-6x+9) \\
T_{2,3}& = 1 + 5x - 15 + \frac{7x^2}{2} - \frac{42x}{2} +\frac{63}{2}  \\
T_{2,3}& = \frac{2}{2} + 5x - \frac{30}{2} + \frac{7x^2}{2} - 21x +\frac{63}{2}  \\
T_{2,3}& = \frac{7x^2}{2} - 16x +\frac{35}{2}  \\
\end{align*}
Thus giving us the answer for the second order Taylor Polynomial centered around 3. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

\textbf{Q03c} We know from the previous question that the second order Taylor Polynomial centered around 3 is:
\[ T_{2,3} = \frac{7x^2}{2} - 16x +\frac{35}{2} \]
Therefore we can approximate $f(5)$ by letting $x = 5$, so we get:
\begin{align*}
T_{2,3}& = \frac{7(5)^2}{2} - 16(5) +\frac{35}{2} \\ 
T_{2,3}& = \frac{175}{2} - 80 +\frac{35}{2} \\
T_{2,3}& = \frac{210}{2} - 80\\
T_{2,3}& = 105 - 80  \\
T_{2,3}& = 25  \\
\end{align*}
In order to find the error for this polynomial we will use Taylor Remainder (page 271) such that:
\[ |R_{2,3}| = |f(5) - T_{2,3}(5)| \]
We can thus apply Taylor's Theorem (page 272), such that this becomes:
\begin{align*}
|R_{2,3}| & = f(5) - T_{2,3}(5)|  \\ 
|R_{2,3}| & = |\frac{f'''(c)}{(2+1)!}(5-3)^(2+1)|  \\
|R_{2,3}| & = |\frac{f'''(c)}{(3!}(2)^(3)|   \\
|R_{2,3}| & = |\frac{f'''(c)}{6}8|  
\end{align*}
In order to find the maximum error we thus need to find the largest possible magnitude of f'''(c), and since:
\[ -4 \leq f'''(c) \leq -1 \]
The largest possible magnitude is |-4|, so the largest possible error will be when $f'''(c) = -4$. Plugging this in we get:
\begin{align*}
|R_{2,3}| & = |\frac{-4}{6}8|  
|R_{2,3}| & = |\frac{-16}{3}|  
R_{2,3} & = \frac{16}{3}
\end{align*}
Therefore the upper bound on the error is $\frac{16}{3}$
Since we are finding this polynomial centered at x = 3, the polynomial becomes:
\[ T_{2,3}= \frac{f(3)}{0!}(x-3)^0 + \frac{f'(3)}{1!}(x-3)^1 + \frac{f''(3)}{2!}(x-3)^2  \]
From definition we know that $f(3) = 1$, $f'(3) = 5$ and $f''(3) = 7$, so we can simplify:
\begin{align*}
T_{2,3}& = \frac{1}{0!} + \frac{5}{1!}(x-3)^1 + \frac{7}{2!}(x-3)^2 \\
T_{2,3}& = 1 + 5(x-3) + \frac{7}{2}(x^2-6x+9) \\
T_{2,3}& = 1 + 5x - 15 + \frac{7x^2}{2} - \frac{42x}{2} +\frac{63}{2}  \\
T_{2,3}& = \frac{2}{2} + 5x - \frac{30}{2} + \frac{7x^2}{2} - 21x +\frac{63}{2}  \\
T_{2,3}& = \frac{7x^2}{2} - 16x +\frac{35}{2}  \\
\end{align*}
Thus giving us the answer for the second order Taylor Polynomial. \\
