\textbf{Q01A} We know that the possible congruence classes [a] of $\mathbb Z_7$ are:

\[ [a] \equiv [0], [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6] \]

These congruence classes would have the following addition table:

\begin{center}
 \begin{tabular}{||c | | c c c c c c c||} 
 \hline
             + & [0] & [1] & [2] & [3] & [4] & [5] & [6]\\ 
 \hline
\hline
\text{[0]} & [0] & [1] & [2] & [3] & [4] & [5] & [6] \\ 
\text{[1]} & [1] & [2] & [3] & [4] & [5] & [6] & [0] \\ 
\text{[2]} & [2] & [3] & [4] & [5] & [6] & [0] & [1] \\ 
\text{[3]} & [3] & [4] & [5] & [6] & [0] & [1] & [2] \\ 
\text{[4]} & [4] & [5] & [6] & [0] & [1] & [2] & [3] \\ 
\text{[5]} & [5] & [6] & [0] & [1] & [2] & [3] & [4] \\ 
\text{[6]} & [6] & [0] & [1] & [2] & [3] & [4] & [5] \\ 
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

They would also have the following multiplication tables:

\begin{center}
 \begin{tabular}{||c | | c c c c c c c||} 
 \hline
    $\cdot$ & [0] & [1] & [2] & [3] & [4] & [5] & [6]\\ 
 \hline
\hline
\text{[0]} & [0] & [0] & [0] & [0] & [0] & [0] & [0] \\ 
\text{[1]} & [0] & [1] & [2] & [3] & [4] & [5] & [6] \\ 
\text{[2]} & [0] & [2] & [4] & [6] & [1] & [3] & [5] \\ 
\text{[3]} & [0] & [3] & [6] & [2] & [5] & [1] & [4] \\
\text{[4]} & [0] & [4] & [1] & [5] & [2] & [6] & [3] \\ 
\text{[5]} & [0] & [5] & [3] & [1] & [6] & [4] & [2] \\ 
\text{[6]} & [0] & [6] & [5] & [4] & [3] & [2] & [1] \\ 
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\textbf{Q01B} Visually we know that $\mathbb Z_7$ is a field, if we look at the multiplication table, each possible congruence class [a] has a corresponding congruence class $[b]^{-1}$ such that:

\[ [a][b]  \equiv 1 \]

This happens because 7 is a prime and [a] is co-prime to 7. This means that $ d = \gcd([a],7]) = 1$ and by definition of MAT since $d|1$ there must be a solution [b] for each [a] that solves the above equality (which means [a] will have a multiplictive inverse). This means that $\mathbb Z_7$ is a field\\\\
On the other hand if we take $\mathbb Z_8$, we know that 8 is not prime and thus not all [a]'s are co-prime to 8. If [a] is not coprime to 8 this would result in $d = \gcd([a],[8]) \neq 1$ and thus MAT could not apply as $d\nmid1$, which means for all possible [b] values of that given [a]:

\[ [a][b] \not\equiv 1 \]

Which means that [a] has no multiplicative illustrative . As an illistutive example lets consider [a] = [2] the multiplicative table will give us:

\begin{center}
 \begin{tabular}{||c | | c c c c c c c c||} 
 \hline
    $\cdot$ & [0] & [1] & [2] & [3] & [4] & [5] & [6] & [7]\\ 
 \hline
\hline
\text{[2]} & [0] & [2] & [4] & [6] & [0] & [2] & [4] & [6] \\ 
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

We can thus see that [1] is never a result and thus [a] will never have a multiplicative  inverse in $\mathbb Z_8$, thus it is not a field.
