\textbf{Q02b} Given that $n$ is a positive integer we know that from 2A that the total number of divisors of $n$ is equal to:
$PROVE THAT F(N) = MULTIPLE OF EACH PRIME FACTOR$
$F(N) CAN BE SPLIT UP INTO:$
N CAN BE REPRESENTED BY PRIMES WHICH MEANS THAT
$F(N) = F(P_1) f(p_2)$
WHICH EQUALS MULTIPLE OF EACH PRIME FACTOR
